# Healthcare-ML-Project 🩺 👨‍💻
Dummy data with Multi Category Classification Problem

💡 This is my first project using machine learning 👨🏻‍💻 to analyze and predict outcomes based on the healthcare dataset available on Kaggle.

I used various libraries, including NumPy and Pandas, to pre-process and explore the data ⚙️, and I implemented machine learning algorithms 🦿🖥️to gain insights and make predictions in the healthcare domain.
