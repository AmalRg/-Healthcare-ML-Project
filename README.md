# Healthcare-ML-Project
Dummy data with Multi Category Classification Problem

This is my first project using machine learning to analyze and predict outcomes based on the healthcare dataset available on Kaggle.

I used various libraries, including NumPy and Pandas, to pre-process and explore the data, and I implemented machine learning algorithms to gain insights and make predictions in the healthcare domain.
